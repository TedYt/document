#Detailed:

Android has an interesting command called dumpsys  to dump some system information. Even described on adb manual  I think that some points should be reinforced. In order to get the complete status just run (will produce a large output):

adb shell dumpsys
Also you can apply filters to running services:

1 SurfaceFlinger
2 accessibility

3 account

4 activity

5 alarm

6 appwidget

7 audio

8 backup

9 battery

10 batteryinfo

11 bluetooth

12 bluetooth_a2dp

13 clipboard

14 connectivity

15 content

16 cpuinfo

17 device_policy

18 devicestoragemonitor
19 diskstats

20 dropbox

21 entropy

22 ethernet

23 hardware

24 input_method

25 iphonesubinfo

26 isms

27 keybar

28 location

29 media.audio_flinger

30 media.audio_policy

31 media.camera

32 media.player

33 meminfo

34 mount

35 netstat

36 network_management
37 notification

38 package

39 permission

40 phone

41 power

42 search

43 sensorservice

44 simphonebook

45 statusbar

46 telephony.registry

47 throttle

48 uimode

49 usagestats

50 vibrator

51 wallpaper

52 wifi

53 window

Some examples:

adb shell dumpsys wifi
adb shell dumpsys cpuinfo
I suggest you try other items on the list above and be creative using all the power of Unix pipes. Example, to get all memory allocated by each process you can do something like:

adb shell dumpsys meminfo | grep "allocated:" | awk '{total = total + $5}END{print total}
